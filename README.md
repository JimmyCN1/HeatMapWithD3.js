# Visualising Data With a Heat Map

This project will show the Monthly Global Land-Surface Temperature from 1753 to 2015. A base temperature of 8.33 is used and the map will aim to shed light on global temperature trends of over the last 300 years.

The map will be generated using **d3.js, ajax, html and css**.
